# Brick_BreakerFinal
This is a generic brick Breaker game written in C++ language. This game has input from the keyboard and can only be played on Microsoft PC's. The game still has lag because it plays in the terminal and seconds can go only so fast. When you play it, you will want to move the userBox sooner then later so the ball can ricochet.

On behalf of this game, Benjamin Franklin was my partner
